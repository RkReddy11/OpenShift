Kubernetes (K8s) and OpenShift are related but distinct container management platforms. While OpenShift is built on top of Kubernetes, it adds additional components and features that enhance the functionality and ease of use. Here are the key differences between the components of Kubernetes and OpenShift:

Container Runtime:

Kubernetes: Kubernetes is designed to be container runtime-agnostic, meaning it can work with various container runtimes such as Docker, containerd, or CRI-O.
OpenShift: OpenShift uses the same container runtimes as Kubernetes but also includes support for its own container runtime called CRI-O. CRI-O is a lightweight, secure, and optimized container runtime specifically designed for OpenShift.
Web Console:

Kubernetes: Kubernetes provides a basic web-based dashboard that offers limited functionality for managing and monitoring clusters.
OpenShift: OpenShift includes a more advanced and feature-rich web console that provides a comprehensive user interface for managing applications, deployments, services, and other resources. The OpenShift console offers a more user-friendly experience and additional capabilities beyond what the Kubernetes dashboard provides.
Source-to-Image (S2I):

Kubernetes: Kubernetes does not include native support for Source-to-Image (S2I). S2I is a build strategy that simplifies the process of building container images from source code.
OpenShift: OpenShift integrates the Source-to-Image (S2I) framework, which allows developers to easily build and deploy applications directly from source code repositories without the need for manual container image creation and management.
Developer Experience:

Kubernetes: Kubernetes primarily focuses on providing infrastructure and orchestration capabilities. It offers a lower-level API and leaves many application-related tasks to developers.
OpenShift: OpenShift places a strong emphasis on the developer experience. It provides a more streamlined and opinionated workflow for building, deploying, and managing applications. OpenShift offers features like integrated CI/CD, developer tooling, and built-in application lifecycle management, making it more developer-friendly compared to vanilla Kubernetes.
Image Registry:

Kubernetes: Kubernetes does not include a built-in container image registry. Users typically rely on external container image registries like Docker Hub or private registries for storing and distributing container images.
OpenShift: OpenShift incorporates a built-in container image registry called the OpenShift Container Registry (OCR). OCR enables users to store, manage, and deploy container images within the OpenShift platform itself, providing a seamless integration for image management.
Security Features:

Kubernetes: Kubernetes provides basic security features such as role-based access control (RBAC) and network policies for controlling access and network traffic between pods.
OpenShift: OpenShift builds on top of Kubernetes' security features and adds additional layers of security, such as enhanced RBAC, image signing and verification, secure container runtime (CRI-O), and default pod security policies. OpenShift places a strong emphasis on security, making it more suitable for enterprise and production environments.
Overall, while Kubernetes focuses on providing a flexible and extensible container orchestration platform, OpenShift adds higher-level abstractions, additional components, and features to provide a more comprehensive and opinionated container management solution. OpenShift's components and enhancements make it well-suited for enterprise environments that prioritize ease of use, developer productivity, security, and integrated tooling.
