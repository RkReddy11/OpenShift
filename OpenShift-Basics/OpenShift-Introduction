OpenShift is a container application platform developed by Red Hat, which is a subsidiary of IBM. It is based on Kubernetes, an open-source container orchestration platform, and adds additional features and tools to simplify the deployment, management, and scaling of containerized applications. OpenShift provides developers with a comprehensive set of tools and services for building, deploying, and running applications in a cloud environment.

Here are some key features of OpenShift that make it great:

Containerization: OpenShift leverages the power of containerization to package applications and their dependencies into lightweight and portable containers. This allows for consistent deployment across different environments and eliminates the "it works on my machine" problem.

Kubernetes Integration: OpenShift builds upon Kubernetes, providing a more streamlined and user-friendly interface. It automates many Kubernetes tasks, such as deployment, scaling, and management, making it easier for developers and operators to work with containers.

Developer Productivity: OpenShift offers a wide range of developer-centric tools and features to enhance productivity. It provides built-in support for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD), allowing developers to automate the software delivery pipeline. It also supports popular programming languages, frameworks, and databases, enabling developers to work with their preferred tools.

Scalability and High Availability: OpenShift enables applications to scale effortlessly by automatically managing the creation and distribution of container replicas across a cluster of machines. It ensures high availability by monitoring the health of containers and restarting or rescheduling them if necessary.

Application Lifecycle Management: OpenShift supports the entire application lifecycle, from development to production and beyond. It provides features for version control, collaboration, testing, and monitoring, making it easier to manage applications at every stage.

Multi-Cloud and Hybrid Cloud Support: OpenShift is designed to work across multiple cloud providers, allowing organizations to avoid vendor lock-in. It provides a consistent experience and management interface regardless of the underlying infrastructure, making it easier to adopt a multi-cloud or hybrid cloud strategy.

Security and Compliance: OpenShift incorporates various security features to protect applications and data. It provides built-in authentication and authorization mechanisms, along with integration with identity management systems. OpenShift also supports compliance with industry standards and regulations, such as PCI-DSS and GDPR.

Extensibility: OpenShift is highly extensible, allowing developers to customize and extend its capabilities. It provides a rich ecosystem of plugins, extensions, and APIs for integrating with other tools and services.

Overall, OpenShift simplifies the process of deploying and managing containerized applications, boosts developer productivity, and provides scalability, flexibility, and security. It is a comprehensive platform for organizations looking to adopt cloud-native architectures and take full advantage of containerization and orchestration technologies
